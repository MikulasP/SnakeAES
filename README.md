# SnakeAES

This is one of the most simple AES implementation in python (also works on Micropython). 

For now the only supported mode is AES ECB with 128 bit long keys, and no padding. 

A little background
-------------------

This code was put together in about a week, without any previous knowledge of the AES or any other encryption algorythms.
Since I wrote is for an assignment I did not have much time to work on it, and it is far from optional. But it's functional after all.

I wish to return working on this code in the not too distant future, and make it better (and a proper AES library).

Until then, feel free to use and modify for your own needs. :)
